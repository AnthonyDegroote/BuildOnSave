# BuildOnSave for Visual Studio 2022 [Preview]

This repository is an attempt to port the **BuildOnSave** extension to **Visual Studio 2022**.

The original **BuildOnSave** extension was developed by [pragmatrix](https://github.com/pragmatrix/BuildOnSave) and provides an automatic build feature whenever a file is saved.

## Goals
- Adapt the extension to work with the latest Visual Studio extensibility model.
- Maintain the core functionality of the original extension.
- Ensure compatibility and stability with Visual Studio 2022.
